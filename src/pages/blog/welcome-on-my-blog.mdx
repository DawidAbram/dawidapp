Welcome to my new portfolio and blog at [**dawid.app**](https://dawid.app)!

As a web developer, I understand the importance of showcasing my work and sharing my experiences.
That's why I have created this website, to give you a glimpse into my journey as a web developer and to share my knowledge and expertise with the community.

## Source Code

For those who are interested in source code of this website, it is available on [**Github**](https://github.com/DawidAbram/dawidapp).
You can use the code for your own projects in any way you want.
I believe that open-source projects contribute to the growth of the developer community, and I am proud to be a part of it.

## Watch me build

If you are interested in seeing the process of how this website was built, you can watch me build it on [**my youtube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@webdevbydawid).
Even though the videos are not necessarily tutorials. You will be able to see the whole process with challenges I faced, the solutions I came up with,
and how I went about creating this portfolio and blog.

## What kind of content can you expect?

I will be posting regularly about my journey as a web developer, including my open-source projects and tutorials.
I will also be sharing my personal projects, the problems I encounter, and how I solve them.
Hopefully by sharing my experiences, I can help others avoid similar obstacles and learn from my mistakes.
Additionally, I will be sharing tips and tricks that I have learned along the way to help others grow in their careers as web developers.

So, whether you are just starting out in the world of web development or you are a seasoned professional, I invite you to join me on this journey.
Subscribe to my youtube, follow me on social media, and let's learn and grow together!
