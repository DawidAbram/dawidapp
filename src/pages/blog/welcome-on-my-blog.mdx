Welcome on my new portfolio and blog at [**dawid.app**](https://dawid.app)!

You can also watch me build it on [**my youtube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@webdevbydawid) if you are interested.


## What kind of content can you expect?

I will be posting about my journey as a web developer, my open source projects, and some tutorials.
I will also be posting about my personal projects, problems I encounter, and how I managed to solve them.
